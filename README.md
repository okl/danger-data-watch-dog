## Setting up your dev environment

Initial setup:

 * clone it from github
 * `vagrant up`
 * subsequently, `vagrant halt` to stop; `vagrant up` to restart

ssh:

 * `vagrant ssh` to  ssh in

Other things you may need to do:

 * `sudo rm -r /etc/icinga/conf.d/*; sudo cp -r /vagrant/service/output/* /etc/icinga/conf.d/` to replace existing icinga config directory with icinga config that was generated by dwd
 * `sudo service icinga restart` to actually reload icinga config that’s been generated by dwd
 * `ssh -p 2200 …` is useful if you need to set up ssh-tunneling for some reason(vagrant user’s password is vagrant)

## TODO

1. Stick logging in
2. Support some sort of grouping mechanisms
3. Scheduling


## Development

### To run unit tests: `lein with-profile dev test`

### To see logging with nrepl
1. Open a shell and run `lein with-profile dev repl`
2. From emacs, run `M-x nrepl` (this will connect to that server)
3. That's it! Your log messages will appear in the shell you opened on
   the server!
